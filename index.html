          <li>Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni was born in 6 March 1475 in Caprese near Arezzo, Republic of Florence (present-day Tuscany, Italy)</li>
          <li>Known for his mastry in sculpture, painting, architecture, and poetry</li>
          <li>He was a major influence in the ronaisance movement</li>
         <li> A number of Michelangelo's works in painting, sculpture, and architecture rank among the most famous in existence.[1] His output in every field of interest was prodigious; given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences taken into account, he is the best-documented artist of the 16th century.</li>
          <li>Michelangelo died in Rome in 1564, at the age of 88 (three weeks before his 89th birthday). His body was taken from Rome for interment at the Basilica of Santa Croce, fulfilling the maestro's last request to be buried in his beloved Florence.</li>
          <li>Notable work: David, Piet√†, The Last Judgment, Sistine Chapel ceiling</li>
          <li>he was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive.</li>

            That burns me from afar and keeps itself ice-chill;</br>
            A strength I feel two shapely arms to fill</br>
            Which without motion moves every balance."</br>
